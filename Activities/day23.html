   <h4 id="tasks-activities-">Tasks/Activities:</h4> 
   <p><strong>Activity 1: Median of Two Sorted Arrays</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Solve the "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of integers and returns the median of the two sorted arrays.</li> 
      <li>Log the median for a few test cases, including edge cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 2: Merge k Sorted Lists</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Solve the "Merge k Sorted Lists" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes an array of k linked lists, each linked list is sorted in ascending order, and merges all the linked lists into one sorted linked list.</li> 
      <li>Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the merged list.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 3: Trapping Rain Water</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Solve the "Trapping Rain Water" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, and computes how much water it can trap after raining.</li> 
      <li>Log the amount of trapped water for a few test cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 4: N-Queens</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Solve the "N-Queens" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that places n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.</li> 
      <li>Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 5: Word Ladder</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 5:</strong> Solve the "Word Ladder" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes a begin word, an end word, and a dictionary of words, and finds the length of the shortest transformation sequence from the begin word to the end word, such that only one letter can be changed at a time and each transformed word must exist in the word list.</li> 
      <li>Log the length of the shortest transformation sequence for a few test cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul>
