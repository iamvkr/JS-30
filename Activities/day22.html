   <h4 id="tasks-activities-">Tasks/Activities:</h4> 
   <p><strong>Activity 1: Add Two Numbers</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 1:</strong> Solve the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.</li> 
      <li>Create a few test cases with linked lists and log the sum as a linked list.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 2: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 2:</strong> Solve the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes a string and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.</li> 
      <li>Log the length for a few test cases, including edge cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 3: Container With Most Water</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 3:</strong> Solve the "Container With Most Water" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the height of a line drawn at each point. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container holds the most water.</li> 
      <li>Log the maximum amount of water for a few test cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 4: 3Sum</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 4:</strong> Solve the "3Sum" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes an array of integers and finds all unique triplets in the array which give the sum of zero.</li> 
      <li>Log the triplets for a few test cases, including edge cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Activity 5: Group Anagrams</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Task 5:</strong> Solve the "Group Anagrams" problem on LeetCode.
     <ul> 
      <li>Write a function that takes an array of strings and groups anagrams together.</li> 
      <li>Log the grouped anagrams for a few test cases.</li> 
     </ul> </li> 
   </ul> 
   <h4 id="feature-request-">Feature Request:</h4>
